# QuestHunt - Gamified To-Do list

_**🚧 This website is WIP! 🚧**_

Transform your everyday tasks into engaging quests with this gamified to-do list, right inside your browser.<br />

## ❓ Why this exists
This exists to help people with ADHD complete tasks, whether it comes to school, work, chores, or whatever you can  think of. While there are apps like these available, they are typically limited to phones. Therefore, I created one for the web, allowing you to access it on your school, work, or home laptop.
